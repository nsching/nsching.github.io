summary: "My team, Island Invaders, designed and created a web-application using Meteor React which aims to address invasive species management challenges by establishing a citizen science initiative to bring the community together and educate people on invasive species, raising awareness and empowering the community and professionals to be able to better track the harmful species and care for the ecosystem. It should serve as an educational resource and also a centralized app for people to report and help manage invasive species across the Hawaiian Islands."

# 'Imi means "search" in ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi
Invasive species pose a significant threat to local ecosystems, causing ecological imbalances or even extinction. However, monitoring and tracking these invasive species across the Hawaiian islands can be a daunting and resource-expensive task, making research difficult to complete.

‘Imi Invasive aims to address invasive species management challenges by establishing a citizen science initiative to bring the community together and educate people on invasive species, raising awareness and empowering the community and professionals to be able to better track the harmful species and care for the ecosystem.

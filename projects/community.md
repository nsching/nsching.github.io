As community service chair of Beta Beta Gamma, a 501(c) non-profit, I'm in charge of coordinating at least one community service event a month. However, I usually schedule two events per month so everyone can participate in helping our community despite their scheduling differences. As someone who was born and raised in Hawaii, a lot of my efforts are towards helping problems that are specific to our local community. In 2023 from the months November to December, I planned some of my favorite community service events of the year.

## A Thankful November
During the month of November I planned two community service events. One was with the local non-profit, JSKT or "Just Small Kine Things," which is also another 501(c). We partnered together to clean up microplastics at Kalama Beach. With our numbers combined, we were able to fill our mason jars with microplastics that JSKT could then dispose of responsibly.

The second event that I found for us to participate in was with Aloha Tree Alliance. They focus on restoring native trees and plants in Kuliouou Valley. I grew up in the Kuliouou district, so it was important to me that we were able to restore the native ecosystem in a district that is so near and dear to my heart. After a long morning of digging holes, planting trees, and carrying jugs of water up and down the trail, we were able to help the Aloha Tree Alliance plant 300 native trees and flora in total. 

## A Christmas miracle
Every local person is aware of the housing crisis in Hawaii. 

## How this helps me grow

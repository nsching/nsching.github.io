I am lucky enough to live in a neighborhood that is close enough to the ocean that I can walk to it. I grew up going to the water to fish and surf whenever it was possible. However, I noticed that there was an excessive amount of seaweed called "gorilla ogo," in the water and on the shoreline. This led me to dig deeper into learning what invasive seaweed was and what I could do to help. 

I made this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/7EjPo7JJSfg?si=0CqL1GcHlBwO8TW-) as a PSA to the residents and visitors of Hawaii about the invasive seaweed issue in our neighborhood. Making this video sharpened my research skills. I searched for information to include in my video from reputable sources like Hawaii DLNR and NOAA. I also included why it was harmful to our native ecosystem, and what is being done to help the situation.

I use this video to help educate people that I take to Kawaikui Beach-park to remove invasive seaweed and encourage them to ask questions if they are unsure what is native and what is invasive. After two invasive seaweed clean-ups, I was able to see a difference in native algae and seaweed. I felt like I saw more than I ever had on that shoreline after our clean-ups. Community is one of the most important pillars of my life, so I am thankful that I can help make a difference.
